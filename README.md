# MyReads Project

This project is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books. It consists of two pages:
- Main page
- Search page

### Main Page
The main page displays your current books.  They are divided into the following categories:
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

By clicking on the green circle with the white triangle on the lower right corner of each book, you can move books to the other categories.  Selecting "none" removes the book from your current books.

Clicking on the green circle with white plus symbol on the lower right corner of page takes you to the Search page.

### Search page
You can search for books by entering search words in the search text box on top of the page.  Up to 20 books will be returned from your search.  Similarly to the Main page, each book will have a white triangle on the lower right corner.  You can add a book to one of the three categories of your current books.  You can also remove the book from your current books by choosing "none".

To go back to the Main page, you can click on the left arrow to the left of the search text box.  Your changes from the Search page will appear on the Main Page.
